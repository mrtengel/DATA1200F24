    <h1>How to apply for exchange</h1>
    <p>Want to go on exchange? Here is the information you need about the deadlines, the application process and the application form.</p>

    <h2>1. Where can you go on exchange?</h2>
    <p>OsloMet has exchange agreements with many partner universities across the world. Find the opportunities available for your study programme and which semester you might be eligible to go abroad. Some study programs might also have other opportunities for doing part of your studies abroad such as field work, shorter stays, projects or other opportunities.</p>
    <p>If you need guidance or more information you can contact the international coordinator for your study programme. If you want to hear more about other students' experiences with a particular institution abroad, we encourage you to ask via the OsloMet Utveksling facebook group (facebook.com).</p>
