            <h2>Where can you go on exchange?</h2>
            <p>OsloMet has exchange agreements with many partner universities across the world. Find the opportunities available for your study programme and which semester you might be eligible to go abroad. Some study programs might also have other opportunities for doing part of your studies abroad such as field work, shorter stays, projects or other opportunities.</p>

If you want to hear more about other students' experiences with a particular institution abroad, we encourage you to ask via the OsloMet Utveksling Facebook group (facebook.com).</p>
