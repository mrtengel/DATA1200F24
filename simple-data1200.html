    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Today, the web and the internet have an important and central social role and are of fundamental importance to those who will have data processing and IT as a profession. In this course, the web will be a platform for establishing knowledge of and skills in ideas, technology and methodology that are central to the professional area of ‚Äã‚Äãdata and IT.</p>
    
    <h3>Teaching and learning methods</h3>
        <p>Lectures and exercises. Students normally collaborate in groups of 3 to 5 (highly recommended) for both the obligatory assignments, as well as the Final assignment (which is graded). The groups are not necessarily the same through the semester.</p>

        <p>Self-study with active use of external resources is expected.</p>

    <h2>Showcasing utf-8</h2>
    <h3>√¶√ò√•</h3>
        <p>These may be written as <code> '&amp;aelig;', '&amp;Oslash;', '&amp;aring;'</code> as well: &aelig; &Oslash; &aring;</p>
    <h3>„Ç´„É≥„Éê„É≥</h3>
    <p>The original "ASCII" had only basic American-English characters. Even missin the '&aelig;' that is an aceptable, though arcaic, character in British-English.</p>
    <h3>ÁúãÊùø</h3>
        <p>Unicode (utf-8) even covers emojies &#9994;</p>
    <h3><em>That went well! (Not!üòù)</em></h3>
        <p><em>In 2023, when I prepared a similar lecture, Safari would display "international" characters incorrectly if you forgot the</em> <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> <em>tag, while Chrome would "assume" the UTF-8. Now, Chrome, Firefox & Safari <strong>all</strong> display characters correctly without the meta-tag!</em></p>
